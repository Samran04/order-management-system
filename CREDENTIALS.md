## 🔑 Important Notes

### Data Storage
- ✅ All user accounts are stored in **browser localStorage**
- ✅ Each browser/device maintains its own user database
- ⚠️ **Clearing browser data will delete all accounts and orders**

### Security Considerations
- 🔒 This is a **demo/development system** with basic authentication
- 🔒 Passwords are stored in **plain text** in localStorage
- 🔒 **NOT suitable for production use** without implementing proper backend authentication
- 🔒 For production, implement:
  - Backend API with secure password hashing (bcrypt)
  - JWT or session-based authentication
  - Database storage (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
  - HTTPS encryption

### Multi-User Testing
To test multiple users simultaneously:
1. Use different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
2. Use incognito/private windows
3. Each will have separate localStorage and user sessions

---

## 🚀 Quick Login Process

### For Returning Users

1. Open the application
2. Enter your **email** and **password**
3. Click **Login**
4. You'll be redirected to the Dashboard

### Auto-Save Feature

The login form includes auto-save functionality:
- ✅ Form data is automatically saved as you type
- ✅ Previous emails, names, and organizations appear in dropdown suggestions
- ✅ Drafts persist even if you close the browser

---

## 🔄 Password Reset

Since this is a localStorage-based system:

### Option 1: Re-register
1. Use a different email address
2. Create a new account

### Option 2: Manual Reset (Developer)
1. Open browser **Developer Tools** (F12)
2. Go to **Application** → **Local Storage**
3. Find `us81_users_db`
4. Edit the password for your user
5. Refresh the page

### Option 3: Clear All Data
1. Open browser **Developer Tools** (F12)
2. Go to **Application** → **Local Storage**
3. Delete all `us81_*` entries
4. Refresh and start fresh
